  - `useMemo` for expensive computations (border colors, validation states)
  - `useCallback` for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Memoized validation props to reduce prop drilling overhead

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive performance monitoring system

  - Component render frequency monitoring
  - Memory usage tracking (cache size, active requests)
  - Performance recommendations based on metrics
  - Development-only monitoring to avoid production overhead

## Task 9.2: Security Hardening ✅

  - Prevention of accidental password exposure in logs

### 2. HTTPS Enforcement Verification
- **Implementation**: URL security auditing system
- **Features**:
  - Automatic detection of non-HTTPS URLs in production
  - Exception handling for localhost/development environments
  - Security violation reporting for HTTP usage
  - HIBP API URL validation on initialization

### 3. Input Sanitization Validation
- **Implementation**: Multi-layer input sanitization
- **Features**:
  - HTML escaping and URL encoding
  - XSS pattern detection and removal
  - Dangerous script pattern filtering
  - Input validation audit logging

### 4. Error Information Disclosure Prevention
- **Implementation**: Error message sanitization system
- **Features**:
  - Sensitive information pattern detection in error messages
  - Automatic redaction of sensitive data (hashes, tokens, keys)
  - User-friendly error message validation
  - Production-safe error reporting

### 5. Validation Bypass Prevention
- **Implementation**: Server-side validation enforcement
- **Features**:
  - Mandatory backend validation for all password operations
  - Input type and format validation
  - Consistent validation rule application
  - Security audit endpoint for testing (development only)

### 6. Rate Limiting Effectiveness
- **Implementation**: Enhanced rate limiting system
- **Features**:
  - Configurable request intervals (100ms minimum)
  - Request timing enforcement
  - Rate limit violation detection and reporting
  - Graceful handling of rate limit exceeded scenarios
